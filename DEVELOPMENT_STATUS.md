# Development Status

## Current Status

The Triton Rust AdminUI project is in active development. Below is a summary of the current status and next steps.

### What's Implemented

- **Backend API**: 
  - JWT-based authentication
  - LDAPS integration for UFDS authentication
  - API endpoints for VMs, servers, networks, images, packages
  - Service layers to communicate with Triton components
  - Error handling and middleware

- **Frontend**:
  - Basic React frontend structure with TypeScript
  - Authentication flow
  - Placeholders for main resource pages
  - API client integration

- **Development Environment**:
  - Mock server with sample data
  - Docker Compose setup for local development
  - Environment configuration templates

### Build Status

- The application builds successfully with minor warnings about unused imports and variables
- All API endpoints are defined and mapped
- Service implementations are in place, but some have placeholder logic
- Frontend builds and can communicate with the backend

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Complete Service Implementations**:
   - Connect to real Triton services using LDAPS for authentication
   - Implement proper error handling for service communication failures
   - Add validation for input payloads

2. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints
   - Set up end-to-end testing with the mock server

3. **Frontend Enhancement**:
   - Complete implementation of resource management views
   - Add visualization components for statistics
   - Implement responsive design for mobile users

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Clean up warnings about unused variables and imports
   - Add comprehensive documentation for API endpoints
   - Standardize error responses and logging

### Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Features**:
   - User management and role-based access control
   - Audit logging for administrative actions
   - Advanced filtering and search capabilities

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed resources
   - Add pagination for large resource collections
   - Optimize database queries and connection pooling

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Add HTTPS support with automatic certificate management
   - Implement more granular permissions
   - Add two-factor authentication options

4. **Monitoring and Metrics**:
   - Integrate with monitoring systems
   - Add metrics for API usage and performance
   - Implement health checks and self-diagnostics
